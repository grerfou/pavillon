Data View


This production is the beginning of a longer term research into our relationship with technology and how it modifies our perceptions, behaviour and ideas.                                                   

In this case I am starting from our point of view of nature to bring this production/research with the aim of materialising the translation into data that the computer creates about concepts that may seem very simple, banal or normal to us humans.
